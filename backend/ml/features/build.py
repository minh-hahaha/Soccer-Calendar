"""Utilities for building feature sets used by the machine learning pipeline.

Historically this module relied on a number of imports that were missing
from the file, leading to ``NameError`` or ``ImportError`` exceptions as
soon as it was imported.  The test-suite imports the
``get_features_for_match`` function from here, so it's important that the
module can be imported without issues.  The patch adds the required
typing, SQLAlchemy, and thirdâ€‘party imports as well as a module level
``typer.Typer`` application instance.
