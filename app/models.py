"""Lightweight data models used by the tests.

The full project defines SQLAlchemy models inside ``backend.database``.
Importing those requires a number of thirdâ€‘party dependencies which may
not be available in the execution environment.  The unit tests only need
simple attribute containers for type hints and mocks, so we provide
minimal ``dataclass`` implementations here.  This keeps the public API
compatible with the expected ``app.models`` module without pulling in the
heavy database stack.
